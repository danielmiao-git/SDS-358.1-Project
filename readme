Statistical analysis of breat cancer cells (response), either malignant or benign, based on various cell physical properties and 
metrics (predictors). For this model, a multiple logistic regression in combination with single predictor logistic regression models 
articulates the most significant properties of cells that affects the cancer state. These are texture, area, smoothness, and concavity. 
In addition is a correlation matrix, univariate and bivariate analyses, and model quality metrics.
